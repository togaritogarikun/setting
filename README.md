## Features
#### About gnuplot
Today (March 17, 2020), following command

    % brew install gnuplot --with-aquaterm --with-x11

does not work well with the latest macOS when you download gnuplot.

Therefore, in this shell script, 
gnuplot will be installed not by homebrew.


If your macOS is catalina, 
you may install gnuplot by

    % brew install gnuplot

but the qt will be used to display.


## Requirements

## Installation

    % cd

    % git clone https://github.com/togaritogarikun/setting.git
